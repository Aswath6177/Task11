//	protected: Accessible within the same package and by subclasses.

//	Answer 2 -
//	Exceptions- are typically used for conditions that a program can catch and handle, allowing for recovery and continued execution.
//	Errors- usually represent more severe problems that are often outside the scope of the program’s control, and handling them is generally not recommended or practical.

//    Answer 3-
//    Checked Exceptions: Must be handled or declared. They are intended for scenarios where recovery is possible and often indicate conditions outside of the program's logic but within its operational scope 
//    Unchecked Exceptions: Do not need to be handled or declared. They generally indicate bugs or logical errors in the program’s code and often require fixing the code rather than handling the exception.
